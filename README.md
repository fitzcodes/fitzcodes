### A Veteran
I spent 8 (okay, well 1 month shy of 8) glorious years in the United States Navy. I was an aircraft electrician and certainly had a wild ride. 

### A Humble Coding Beginning
I started working on code sparadically before I actually separated from the service. Unfortunately that's how it remained for a while after returning to civillian life. I did get pretty decent at HTML and CSS though. 

### \#VetsWhoCode And New Life
One day while surfing the internet I happened to come across an organization called \#VetsWhoCode. I liked what I saw. I stalked all the social media and tried to find every review that might be out there. In my head I was like "Is this real?". 
<br>
The organization and community is perfect for those like me. It's been a huge blessing to have guided discipline while learning to code. Being instructed by industry experts in terms I can understand as a veteran has been amazing. Daunting tasks are much easier with that special support system. Best of all, it's up to date industry standards.
